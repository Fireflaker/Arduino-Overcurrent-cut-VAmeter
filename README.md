WARNING: Use an USB isolator when testing.

# Arduino-Overcurrent-cut-VAmeter
Uses arduino, Oled, rotary encoder and a relay to display, set and switch relay off when current goes higher than the set value.

The Arduino ADC is mostly a joke. AD7705 module will be used if I happen t ocome back to this project.

To do list:
Use AD7705
Add SetTriggerTime and SetReleaseTime 
Add manual on off
Add over temperature control
